# Introduction

 * Hardware
  The car uses [Onshape](https://www.onshape.com/en/) design car's shape, then use Laser cutting machine cut the planks, planks with hexagonal column doing compartment, put hardware in compartment. the drawings are in `models`
  
  Hardware have:
  
    1. Wheel(Front):         Lego 62.4x20 wheel  x2
    2. Wheel(Rear):          Lego 43.2x14 wheel  x2
